# Contributing Guidelines

## Opening Issues

### Bug Reports

Before reporting a bug, make sure nobody has reported it before you. Also, remember to follow the bug template.

## Code Style

[Godot's official GDScript Style guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html)

I'm not going to pretend that I've been following this so far, but we should try to work towards making our code follow it.
